# Installing and Configuring the Python SDK

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for installing the Wyse Mate Python SDK and setting up your development environment. By following these steps, you'll be ready to integrate with AgentOS quickly.

## System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

-   **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher
-   **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux
-   **Dependencies**: All necessary dependencies are automatically handled during the SDK installation process.

## Installation

Choose your preferred method to install the Wyse Mate Python SDK:

### 1. Install via PyPI (Recommended)

The simplest way to install the SDK is using `pip`, Python's package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

```bash
pip install wyse-mate-sdk
```

### 2. Install from Source

If you need the latest development version or plan to contribute to the SDK, you can install it directly from the source code:

```bash
# First, clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/wyse/matego.git
cd matego/sdk/python

# Then, install in editable (development) mode:
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Install with Poetry

For projects using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management:

```bash
poetry add wyse-mate-sdk
```

### 4. Install with Conda

If you prefer [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), you can install the SDK as follows:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge wyse-mate-sdk
```

## Verify Your Installation

After installation, it's good practice to verify that the SDK is correctly installed and accessible. Run the following Python snippet:

```python
import wyse_mate

print(f"Wyse Mate SDK Python version: {wyse_mate.__version__}")

# Test basic imports to ensure core components are available
from wyse_mate import Client, ClientOptions
from wyse_mate.models import TeamInfo
from wyse_mate.errors import APIError

print("âœ… Wyse Mate Python SDK installed successfully!")
```

## Managing Dependencies with Virtual Environments (Recommended)

To prevent dependency conflicts and maintain a clean project environment, we strongly recommend using a Python virtual environment.

### Using `venv`

`venv` is Python's built-in module for creating lightweight virtual environments.

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment (e.g., named 'mate-sdk-env')
python -m venv mate-sdk-env

# Activate the virtual environment:
# On Linux/macOS:
source mate-sdk-env/bin/activate

# On Windows (Command Prompt):
mate-sdk-env\Scripts\activate.bat

# On Windows (PowerShell):
mate-sdk-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Once activated, install the SDK:
pip install wyse-mate-sdk
```

### Using `conda` Environments

If you use Conda, you can create and activate a dedicated environment:

```bash
# Create a new conda environment (e.g., named 'mate-sdk') with Python 3.9
conda create -n mate-sdk python=3.9

# Activate the environment:
conda activate mate-sdk

# Install the SDK within the activated environment:
pip install wyse-mate-sdk
```

## Initial Configuration

After installing the SDK, the next crucial step is to configure your API credentials to enable communication with the Wyse Mate platform. For detailed instructions on obtaining and managing your API key, please refer to the [Authentication](/sdk/python/authentication) guide.

### Preferred Method: `mate.yaml` Configuration File

Storing your API key in a configuration file is the most secure and recommended approach, keeping sensitive information out of your codebase. Create a file named `mate.yaml` in your project's root directory with the following structure:

```yaml
api_key: "your-api-key-here"
base_url: "https://api.mate.wyseos.com"
timeout: 30
debug: false
```

| Field      | Type    | Description                                                 | Default Value             |
| :--------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| `api_key`  | `string`| Your unique API key obtained from the Wyse Mate dashboard. **Required.** | *(None)*                  |
| `base_url` | `string`| The base URL for the Wyse Mate API.                         | `https://api.mate.wyseos.com` |
| `timeout`  | `integer`| The maximum time in seconds for API requests to respond.     | `30`                      |
| `debug`    | `boolean`| Enables or disables debug mode for extended logging.        | `false`                   |

To load this configuration in your Python application:

```python
from wyse_mate import Client
from wyse_mate.config import load_default_config

config = load_default_config()
if config:
    client = Client(config)
else:
    print("Warning: mate.yaml not found. Consider creating one for production.")
    # Fallback to manual configuration (replace with your actual API key)
    from wyse_mate import ClientOptions
    client = Client(ClientOptions(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"))
```

### Alternative: In-Code Configuration

While less ideal for production due to embedding credentials in code, you can also configure the client directly within your Python script using `ClientOptions`.

```python
from wyse_mate import Client, ClientOptions

client = Client(ClientOptions(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", # Replace with your actual API key
    base_url="https://api.mate.wyseos.com",
    timeout=30,
    debug=False
))
```

### Loading from a Custom Configuration Path

If your `mate.yaml` file is located at a non-standard path, specify its location directly:

```python
from wyse_mate import Client
from wyse_mate.config import load_config

# Replace with the actual path to your custom config file
custom_config_path = "path/to/your/custom-mate.yaml"
config = load_config(custom_config_path)
client = Client(config)
```

## Next Steps

With the SDK installed and configured, you're ready to start building! Head over to the [Examples](/sdk/python/examples) section for practical code snippets, or dive deeper into the API functionalities in the [API Reference](/sdk/python/api-reference).
