title: Welcome to WyseOS

WyseOS is an agentic operating system - a multi-agent web automation system designed to orchestrate task planning, perception, memory, and action across a variety of expert agents. This AgentOS for automation understands user intent through natural language and utilizes a planning agent and multiple expert agents to collaboratively complete complex tasks. Unlike conventional multi-agent systems (MAS), WyseOS focuses on seamless integration with web environments, dynamically coordinating agents via high-level planning and stateful memory. Its core features include:

- Precise intent recognition and task orchestration
- Hybrid page element detection combining visual and DOM analysis
- Continuously learning and updating the knowledge base
- A cloud-based sandbox browser with local plugin support
- An SDK for modular expansion.

This article provides an in-depth walkthrough of the WyseOS architecture and presents a detailed use case demonstrating its practical capabilities.
