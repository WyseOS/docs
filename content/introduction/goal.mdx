title: Goals

WyseOS aims to operationalize intelligent agents that can:

- Autonomously navigate the web and digital interfaces
- Decompose complex tasks into goal-directed subtasks
- Utilize large language models (LLMs) for decision-making
- Maintain memory of task context over time
- Adapt to dynamic, real-world environments (DOM changes, latency, partial failures, etc.)

These capabilities align with the broader AgentOS vision of establishing a new class of operating systems where multi-modal agents (vision, language, planning) interact with software interfaces as humans do.

In summary, WyseOS represents an important step toward building smarter, more adaptive, and more user-friendly web automation systems that generalize across tasks, domains, and interface designs. Agents can solve novel tasks with minimal retraining or hardcoded rules, unlocking automation across different domains. Users can also specify goals declaratively, and agents can interpret and fulfill those goals autonomously.

The integration of real-time web perception, contextual memory, and adaptive reasoning allows WyseOS to operate in closed-loop feedback cycles, a key requirement for continuous, interactive systems. This enables the agents to operate continuously, ask for clarification when needed, provide updates, and gracefully recover from errors, mirroring how human assistants behave.
